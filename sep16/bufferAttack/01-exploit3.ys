# Attack 1: A benign caller invokes a function
# who is malicious; upon return the processor

# Initialize the stack
	irmovq	0x2000, %rsp

main:
	call evil	# call function
	halt		# If we return
			# successfully, halt

# Return address is just above the stack pointer:
evil:

	ret

# Place the code you wrote in Step 1 here

# We put this here so you can observe the contents
# of the stack (why is this at 0x1FF0 and not 0x2000?)
