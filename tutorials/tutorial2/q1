1) For this question, the goal is to introduce a new instruction 
    to the y86 called the indirect conditional jump.

- jXX *D(rB)
- semanatics are PC <- M_8[D+R[rB]]
- additional circuity may be needed to route signals to
  appropriate decision points

Fetch
iCd:IFn = M_1[PC]
rA:rB   = M_1[PC+1]
ValC    = M_8[PC+2]
ValP    = PC + 10

Decode
ValB    = Reg[rB]

Execute
ValB    = ValB + ValC
CND     = Cond(CC, iFn)

Memory
ValM    = M_8[ValE]

Write-back
N/A, nothing to write into memory

PC-Update
PC = CND? ValM : ValP
