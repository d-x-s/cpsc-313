Pipeline Timing

Given a processor with the following performance:
Stage 1 takes 100 ps
Stage 2 takes 60 ps
Stage 3 takes 90 ps
Stage 4 takes 120 ps
Each register adds 30 ps

1) Definitions
Latency is how long it takes for an instruction to retire
Throughput is number of instructions retired within a specific period of time

SEQUENTIAL:
2a) Sequential Latency?
100 + 60 + 90 + 120 + 30 = 400ps

2b) How much time it takes for an instruction to get retired?
400ps

2c) Throughput?
(1 instr/400 ps) = (10^3 instr/400s)

PIPELINED:
3a) Pipelined Latency
(120)(4) + (30)(4) = 480 + 120 = 600ps

3b) How much time it takes for an instruction to get retired?
30 + 120 = 150ps (an instruction is retired every 150ps seconds)

3c) Throughput?
(1 instr/150 ps) = (10^3 instr/150)
